# Unit testing with JUnit

Using JUnit, write unit tests for the Doodle backend. You must at least write tests suite for the following functions :

- ExportResource::retrieveUsers()
- SendEmail::sendASimpleEmail()
- Utils::intersect()
- Choice::equals()

Comment your test suites to explain the choice of test cases selected.

Did you find bugs ?

Does that mean that there is no bugs other than those found ?

**The answers to those question should be answered in the [report](../report.md)**
